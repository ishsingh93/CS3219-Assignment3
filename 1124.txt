There, pre-\ndiction tasks were used for quantitative evaluation\nand objective model comparison, while analysis of\nlearned models gave insight about the social process\nbehind the data.\nWe echo this pattern here as we turn our atten-\ntion to language use on restaurant menus and in user\nrestaurant reviews. We use data from a large cor-\npus of restaurant menus and reviews crawled from\nthe web and formulate several prediction tasks. In\naddition to predicting menu prices, we also consider\npredicting sentiment along with price.\nThe relationship between language and senti-\nment is an active area of investigation (Pang and\nLee, 2008). Much of this research has focused on\ncustomer-written reviews of goods and services, and\nperspectives have been gained on how sentiment is\nexpressed in this type of informal text. In addition\nto sentiment, however, other variables are reflected\nin a reviewer\u2019s choice of words, such as the price of\nthe item under consideration. In this paper, we take\na step toward joint modeling of multiple variables\nin review text, exploring connections between price\nand sentiment in restaurant reviews.\nHence this paper contributes an exploratory data"

                        "content": "There are several areas of related work scattered\nthroughout linguistics, NLP, hospitality research,\nand economics.\nFreedman and Jurafsky (2011) studied the use of\nlanguage in food advertising, specifically the words\non potato chip bags. They argued that, due to\nthe ubiquity of food writing across cultures, eth-\nnic groups, and social classes, studying the use of\nlanguage for describing food can provide perspec-\ntive on how different socioeconomic groups self-\nidentify using language and how they are linguisti-\ncally targeted. In particular, they showed that price\naffects how \u201cauthenticity\u201d is realized in marketing\nlanguage, a point we return to in §5. This is an ex-\nample of how price can affect how an underlying\nvariable is expressed in language. Among other ex-\nplorations in this paper, we consider how price inter-\nacts with expression of sentiment in user reviews of\nrestaurants.\nAs mentioned above, our work is related to re-\nsearch in predicting real-world quantities using text\ndata (Koppel and Shtrimberg, 2006; Ghose et al.,\n2007; Lerman et al., 2008; Kogan et al., 2009; Joshi\net al., 2010; Eisenstein et al., 2010; Eisenstein et\nal., 2011; Yogatama et al., 2011). Like much of\nthis prior work, we aim to learn how language is\nused in a specific context while building models that\nachieve competitive performance on a quantitative\nprediction task.\nAlong these lines, there is recent interest in ex-\nploring the relationship between product sales and\nuser-generated text, particularly online product re-\nviews. For example, Ghose and Ipeirotis (2011)\nstudied the sales impact of particular properties of\nreview text, such as readability, the presence of\nspelling errors, and the balance between subjective\nand objective statements. Archak et al. (2011) had a\nsimilar goal but decomposed user reviews into parts\ndescribing particular aspects of the product being\nreviewed (Hu and Liu, 2004). Our paper differs\nfrom price modeling based on product reviews in\nseveral ways. We consider a large set of weakly-\nrelated products instead of a homogeneous selection\nof a few products, and the reviews in our dataset are\nnot product-centered but rather describe the overall\nexperience of visiting a restaurant. Consequently,\nmenu items are not always mentioned in reviews and\nrarely appear with their exact names. This makes it\ndifficult to directly use review features in a pricing\nmodel for individual menu items.\nMenu planning and pricing has been studied for\nmany years by the culinary and hospitality research\ncommunity (Kasavana and Smith, 1982; Kelly et al.,\n1994), often including recommendations for writing\nmenu item descriptions (Miller and Pavesic, 1996;\nMcVety et al., 2008). Their guidelines frequently\ninclude example menus from successful restaurants,\nbut typically do not use large corpora of menus or\nautomated analysis, as we do here. Other work\nfocused more specifically on particular aspects of\nthe language used on menus, such as the study by\nZwicky and Zwicky (1980), who made linguistic ob-\nservations through manual analysis of a corpus of\n200 menus.\nRelatedly, Wansink et al. (2001; 2005) showed\nthat the way that menu items are described af-\nfects customers\u2019 perceptions and purchasing behav-\nior. When menu items are described evocatively,\ncustomers choose them more often and report higher\nsatisfaction with quality and value, as compared to\nwhen they are given the same items described with\nconventional names. Wansink et al. did not use a\ncorpus, but rather conducted a small-scale experi-\nment in a working cafeteria with customers and col-\nlected surveys to analyze consumer reaction. While\nour goals are related, our experimental approach is\ndifferent, as we use automated analysis of thousands\nof restaurant menus and rely on a set of one mil-\nlion reviews as a surrogate for observing customer\nbehavior.\nFinally, the connection between products and\nprices is also a central issue in economics. How-\never, the stunning heterogeneity in products makes\nempirical work challenging. For example, there are\nover 50,000 menu items in New York that include"

Restricting our attention to reviews of 50\u201360\nwords, Table 5 shows sample reviews from our test\nset that lead to various predictions of price range and\nsentiment.5\nThis technique can also be useful when trying to\ndetermine the \u201ctrue\u201d star rating for a review (if pro-\nvided star ratings are noisy), or to show the most\npositive and most negative reviews for a product\nwithin a particular star rating. The 5-point scale\nis merely a coarse approximation to the reviewer\u2019s\nmental state; using fitted models can provide addi-\ntional clues to decode the reviewer\u2019s sentiment.\nWe can also do a more fine-grained analysis of\nreview text by noting the contribution to the price\nrange prediction of each position in the text stream.\nThis is straightforward because our features are sim-\nply n-grams of the review text. In Figure 2, we show\nthe influence of each word in a review sentence on\nthe predicted polarity (brown) and price range (yel-\nlow). The height of a bar at a given position is pro-\nportional to the sum of the feature weights for every\nunigram, bigram, and trigram containing the token\nat that position (there are at most 6 active n-grams\nat a position).\nThe first example shows the smooth shift in ex-\npressed sentiment from the beginning of the sen-\ntence to the end. The second sentence is a difficult\nexample for sentiment analysis, since there are sev-\neral positive words and phrases early but the senti-\nment is chiefly expressed in the final clause. Our\nmodel noted the steady positive sentiment early in\nthe sentence but identified the crucial negation due\nto strong negative weight on bigrams fresh but, left\nme, and me yearning. In both examples, the yellow\nbars show that price estimates are reflected mainly\nthrough isolated mentions of offerings and ameni-\nties (drinks, atmosphere, security, good service)."

Like much of this prior work, we aim to learn how language is used in a specific context while building models that achieve competitive performance on a quantitative prediction task. Along these lines, there is recent interest in exploring the relationship between product sales and user-generated text, particularly online product reviews. For example, Ghose and Ipeirotis (2011) studied the sales impact of particular properties of review text, such as readability, the presence of spelling errors, and the balance between subjective and objective statements. Archak et al. (2011) had a similar goal but decomposed user reviews into parts describing particular aspects of the product being reviewed (Hu and Liu, 2004). Our paper differs from price modeling based on product reviews in several ways. We consider a large set of weaklyrelated products instead of a homogeneous selection of a few products, and the reviews in our dataset are not product-centered but rather describe the overall experience of visiting a restaurant. Consequently, menu items are not always mentioned in reviews and rarely appear with their exact names. This makes it difficult to directly use review fe",

This paper is a step on the way to the eventual goal of using linguistic analysis to understand social phenomena like sales and consumption. 2 Related Work There are several areas of related work scattered throughout linguistics, NLP, hospitality research, and economics. Freedman and Jurafsky (2011) studied the use of language in food advertising, specifically the words on potato chip bags. They argued that, due to the ubiquity of food writing across cultures, ethnic groups, and social classes, studying the use of language for describing food can provide perspective on how different socioeconomic groups selfidentify using language and how they are linguistically targeted.

Pane (c) shows feature weights for ngrams often used to market menu items; we see larger weights for words targeting those who want to eat organically- or locally-grown food (farmhouse, heirloom, wild, and hormone), compared to those looking for comfort food (old time favorite, traditional, real, and fashioned). This is related to observations made by Freedman and Jurafsky (2011) that cheaper food is marketed by appealing to tradition and historicity, with more expensive food described in terms of naturalness, quality of ingredients, and the preparation process (e.g., handpicked, wild caught, etc.). Relatedly, in pane (e) we see that real mashed potatoes are expected to be cheaper than those described as creamy or smooth. Pane (d) shows feature weights for trigrams containing units of chicken; we can see an ordering in terms of size (bits < cubes < strips < cuts) as well as the price increase associated with the use of the word morsels in place of less refined units.",

Our goal is to understand how language is used in the food domain, and we direct our investigation using external variables such as restaurant menu prices. We build on a thread of NLP research that seeks linguistic understanding by predicting real-world quantities from text data. Recent examples include prediction of stock volatility (Kogan et al., 2009) and movie revenues (Joshi et al., 2010). There, prediction tasks were used for quantitative evaluation and objective model comparison, while analysis of learned models gave insight about the social process behind the data. We echo this pattern here as we turn our attention to language use on restaurant menus and in user restaurant reviews. We use data from a large corpus of restaurant menus and reviews crawled from the web and formulate several prediction tasks.

In this paper, we explore questions like these that relate restaurant menus, prices, and customer sentiment. Our goal is to understand how language is used in the food domain, and we direct our investigation using external variables such as restaurant menu prices. We build on a thread of NLP research that seeks linguistic understanding by predicting real-world quantities from text data. Recent examples include prediction of stock volatility (Kogan et al., 2009) and movie revenues (Joshi et al., 2010). There, prediction tasks were used for quantitative evaluation and objective model comparison, while analysis of learned models gave insight about the social process behind the data. We echo this pattern here as we turn our attention to language use on restaurant menus and in user restaurant reviews.

For this task, we again train an `1-regularized linear regression model with integral price ranges as the true output values yi. Each input xi corresponds to the feature vector for an entire restaurant. For evaluation, we round the predicted values to the nearest integer: yi = ROUND(wTxi) and report the corresponding mean absolute error and accuracy. We compared this simple approach with an ordinal regression model (McCullagh, 1980) trained with the same il regularizer and noted very little improvement (77.32% vs. 77.15% accuracy for METADATA). Therefore, we only report in this section results for the linear regression model. In addition to the feature sets used for individual menu item price prediction, we used features on reviews (REVIEWS).

We omit full details of these models because the polarity prediction task for user reviews is wellknown in the sentiment analysis community and our model is not an innovation over prior work (Pang and Lee, 2008). However, our purpose in training the model was to use the learned weights for understanding the text in the reviews. 6.2 Interpreting Reviews Given learned models for predicting a restaurant\u2019s price range from its set of reviews as well as polarity for each review, we can turn the process around and use the feature weights to analyze the review text. Restricting our attention to reviews of 50\u201360 words, Table 5 shows sample reviews from our test set that lead to various predictions of price range and sentiment.5 This technique can also be useful when trying to determine the \u201ctrue\u201d star rating",

Menu planning and pricing has been studied for many years by the culinary and hospitality research community (Kasavana and Smith, 1982; Kelly et al., 1994), often including recommendations for writing menu item descriptions (Miller and Pavesic, 1996; McVety et al., 2008). Their guidelines frequently include example menus from successful restaurants, but typically do not use large corpora of menus or automated analysis, as we do here. Other work focused more specifically on particular aspects of the language used on menus, such as the study by Zwicky and Zwicky (1980), who made linguistic observations through manual analysis of a corpus of 200 menus. Relatedly, Wansink et al. (2001; 2005) showed that the way that menu items are described affects customers\u2019 perceptions and purchasing behavior. When menu items are described evocatively, customers choose them more often and report higher satisfaction with quality and value, as compared to when they are given the same items described with conventional names. Wansink et al. did not use a corpus, but rather conducted a small-scale experiment in a working cafeteria with customers and collected surveys to analyze",
